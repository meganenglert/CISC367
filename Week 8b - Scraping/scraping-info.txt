Information: BoardGameGeek is a massive database of boardgames with over 120,000 individual game entries, featuring pictures, ratings, and reviews for each. All rankings are based on user
ratings of games. Games are ranked by the "Geek Rating", which uses a Bayesian mean, preventing a game with 30 votes of 10 points from being the top game on the whole website. For the 
sake of the length of the data, I filtered out games without enough votes for a rank and games that haven't been released yet, which also do not have a rank. The image link links to a 
picture of the game, the description gives a short verbal description of the game's mechanics and theming, and the average rating is the raw average from recorded votes.
